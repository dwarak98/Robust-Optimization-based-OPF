# Robust-Optimization-based-OPF

Making optimal decisions under uncertainty is an important problem and needs more sophisticated algorithms to apply in real world. The output of a generator is its on/off status under constraints such as load balance, generator constraints and transmission line constraints. Renewable penetration tends to increase in the next few decades and more than 50 percentage of demand will be provided by renewable energy resources. To account for the fluctuations in power output, a number of measures are proposed to overcome the operation and planning problem. These include demand side management, usage of fast ramp generators, battery storages.In addition to the physical means, updating current systems’ planning and operation with stochastic and probabilistic methods has been particularly recommended as a promising solution to help maintain and improve system reliability with increasing penetration of variable energy resources. This report is to investigate why stochastic optimization methods are not widely used in markets, and what could be done to mitigate this issue.
